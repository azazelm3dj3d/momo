# Momo's Quest
Momo's Quest is a C++ game using raylib (inspired by Nene's Quest from New Game!)

Momo's Quest is a short story about an adventurer who wanders into the woods and encounters a horrifying BOSS battle! She'll have to battle this boss with all her might, but in the end, it's up to the player if she wins or loses. Good luck!
