# Momo's Quest

Momo's Quest is a C++ game using raylib!

Momo's Quest is a short story about an adventurer who wanders into the woods and encounters a horrifying BOSS battle! She cannot win, the boss always wins because I didn't implement fighting. I may come back and add some form of conflict, and fix the issues, but this was just a project to mess around with Raylib. The code is pretty much all over the place.

The only requirement is to make sure `raylib` is installed on your system. If running macOS, you can use `brew`, but if you're running Windows/Linux, you may need to download the appropriate resources and update the `.vscode/*.json` files to set the directory for building/running.

Example:
```bash
brew install raylib
```

This was just a project I've been messing with over the past year when I had a few minutes, so I wouldn't expect too many updates moving forward. Feel free to download the executable in the releases to play or build from the source using the `.vscode/*` configuration.

NOTE: The map does not currently have boundaries, so feel free to run off the map too
